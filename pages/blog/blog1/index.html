      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I had spent about a year looking for some artwork to put above my couch, but I never found anything I really
        liked. I wanted something that was either abstract or nature-y, and I wanted it to feature a decent amount of
        red. One day, YouTube recommended me a video of someone recreating Eddie Van Halen's iconic <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstrat">Frankenstrat</a> and I thought "Why not try for myself?"</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>The Process</h2>
      <p>This was a pretty straightforward project, although that's mostly because I was fortunate enough to have access
        to a space where I could spray paint and just make a mess in general. I bought canvases, painter's tape, and
        spray paint of the following varieties: red, orange, yellow, white, and clear coat. I went with those colors to
        go for an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7tHHyXvJII">"Autumn Leaves"</a> vibe.</p>
      <p>The next step was to decide the order I wanted the colors to be layered. The first color you put down will
        be on top of all the rest. I decided to have a different order for each canvas, just for some extra variety.</p>
      <p>There are a million spray painting tutorials online that know better than me, but here is what I kept in mind
        when spraying:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shake the can for about a minute before starting, and shake frequently every couple of seconds when
          spraying.</li>
        <li>Leave some space between you and your painting surface (your can should tell you just how much space to
          have).</li>
        <li>Start and stop spraying outside the edges of your painting surface.</li>
        <li>Try to have a 50% overlap as you go down your painting surface.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I put down about two or three coats of color each round. I basically emptied the cans I bought and I wish I had
        done
        more coats. (see the <a href="#mistakes">Mistakes</a> section for more...).</p>
      <p>The next step after the color layer dried was to put down painter's tape. I mostly stuck with straight lines
        from one edge of the canvas to another. You want to make sure that the tape is firmly pressed down before
        spraying on the next layer (see the <a href="#mistakes">Mistakes</a> section for more...). I repeated this
        process of spraying a color and laying down tape, and left the tape on until after I had sprayed my final
        "background" color (white).
      </p>
      <p>Once I had sprayed my final color and it had dried completely, it was time to peel away all of the layers of
        tape.
        Fortunately, I had a lot of excess tape past the edges of the canvas so it was easy to find places to start
        peeling. I mostly
        worked from the back and edges of the canvas toward the center. I made sure to do this carefully, just in case
        the tape was
        going to lift any paint (fortunately, that did not happen).</p>
      <p>After I removed the tape, I decided to put down a few layers of clear coat. I'm not sure this did anything
        besides cause some of my previously neat paint lines to run a bit (womp womp).</p>

      <p>Here is a small collection of the things I wish I did differntly.</p>

          spray paint. I wish I had gotten at least four cans for these
          three eight square feet canvases.</figcaption>

          extremely inconsistent with its spray pattern, and I ended up with some dots
          on the canvases.</figcaption>
