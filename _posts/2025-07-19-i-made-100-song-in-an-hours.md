On 2023-05-29, I created a [YouTube channel called Overtake](https://www.youtube.com/@OvertakeMusicChannel). On 2023-05-30, I published my first ["Song in an Hour"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj196OobLzA) (even though I had recorded it a few months earlier on 2023-02-16).

I was inspired to start recording these *things* by [another YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v72p2_9GAz8&pp=ygUScnVkeSBheW91YiAzMCBkYXlz) with the hope that it would help prepare me to check off one of my bucket list items: writing and recording an album all by myself from scratch (universe not included).

I believed that starting this project would help me out in two ways:
  1. Getting more proficient with my recording software
  2. Getting the "bad" ideas out to make way for some "good" ideas

I think the biggest leap I've made with my workflow is embracing templates. Projects, tracks, drum grooves, amp sim presets, synth presets, you name it. These things save so much time and are a great way to go from an idea in my head to some sort of prototype in the DAW.

I *think* I've managed to scrape together some interesting riffs and chord progressions over the past two-ish years, but I'm not sure if it's enough for me to start recording a "proper" album. Or maybe that's just my self-defeating personality talking.

Only time will tell.
