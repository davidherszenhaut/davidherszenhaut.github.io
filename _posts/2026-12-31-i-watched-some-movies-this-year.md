Welcome to my very professional and very in-depth thoughts on the (new) movies I saw in 2026.

**28 Years Later: The Bone Temple**: This movie proves that the world needs more [zombie fights in trains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_to_Busan#Plot) and Ralph Fiennes x Iron Maiden performative dancing.  4/5.

**Iron Lung**: I'm a little bit biased because I've enjoyed watching playthroughs of this game in the past (though, funnily enough, never Markiplier's playthrough). I thought this movie did a great job translating the lo-fi visuals of the game into a live action film and I enjoyed (most of) the new lore. I will be deducting points for a lack of spookyfish.jpg jumpscare at the end. 4/5.
