**SmarTrek** is a web application that allows users to search for transportation options in New York City and uses NYPD data to determine a safety rating for reach route.

Supports several routes for each mode of transportation: walking, bicycling, driving, and public transit.

This project was built using React, React-Bootstrap, and Python.
