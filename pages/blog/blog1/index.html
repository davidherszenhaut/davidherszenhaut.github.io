      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I had spent about a year looking for some artwork to put above my couch, but I never found anything I really
        liked. I wanted something that was either abstract or nature-y and I wanted it to feature a decent amount of
        red. One day, YouTube recommended me a video of someone recreating Eddie Van Halen's iconic <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstrat">Frankenstrat</a> and I thought "Why not try for myself?"</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>This was a pretty straightforward project, although I was fortunate enough to have access to a space where I
        could spray paint and just make a mess in general. I bought canvases, painter's tape, and spray paint of the
        following varieties: red, orange, yellow, white, and clear coat.</p>
      <p>The next step is to decide in what order you want the colors to be layered. The first color you put down will
        be on top of all the rest. I decided to have a different order for each canvas, just for some extra variety. For
        the first color, you will want to paint the whole surface.
      <p>
      <p>There are a million spray painting tutorials online that know better than me, but here is what I kept in mind
        when spraying:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shake the can for a minute before starting and shake frequently every couple of seconds when spraying.</li>
        <li>Leave some space between you and your painting surface (your can should tell you just how much space to
          have).</li>
        <li>Start and stop spraying outside the edges of your painting surface.</li>
        <li>Try to have a 50% overlap as you go down your painting surface.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I put down about 2 or 3 coats of color (basically emptying the cans I bought), although I wish I had done more
        (see the <a href="#mistakes">Mistakes</a> section for more...).</p>
      <p>The next step after drying is to put down painter's tape. I mostly stuck with straight lines from one edge of
        the canvas to another. You want to make sure that the tape is firmly pressed down before spraying on the next
        layer (see the <a href="#mistakes">Mistakes</a> section for more...). I repeated this process of spraying a
        color and laying down tape, and left the tape on until after I had sprayed my final "background" color (white).
      </p>
      <p>Once I had sprayed my final color and it had dried completely, it was time to peel away all of the tape.
        Fortunately, I had a lot of excess tape past the edges so it was easy to find places to start peeling. I mostly
        worked from the back of the canvas toward the center. I made sure to do this carefully just in case the tape was
        going to lift any paint (fortunately, that did not happen).</p>
      <p>After I removed the tape, I decided to put down a few layers of clear coat. I'm not sure this did anything
        besides causing some of my previously neat paint lines to run a bit.</p>
