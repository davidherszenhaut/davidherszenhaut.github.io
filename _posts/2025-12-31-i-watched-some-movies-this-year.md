Welcome to my very professional and very in-depth thoughts on the (new) movies I saw in 2025.

**Companion**: I really liked it! 4/5.

**Captain America: Brave New World**: It's just so bad. 1/5.

**The Monkey**: Very fun *Final Destination* style comedy horror. 3/5.

**Mickey 17**: I liked it. 3/5.

**The Amateur**: I feel as though I've seen several movies like this already. 2/5.

**Drop**: It had some tense scenes, but was ultimately a little predictable and had a bit of a rushed ending. 2.5/5.

**Warfare**: I liked it. 3/5.

**Sinners**: This movie would have been amazing even without the vampires. 4.5/5.

**Until Dawn**: Fun little horror movie. 3/5.

**Final Destination Bloodlines**: A very fun addition to the franchise that I think fans of the series will enjoy. My only nitpick is the quality of the CGI. 3/5.

**Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning**: More like *Mid-ssion: Impossible*, am I right? 2.5/5.

**Predator: Killer of Killers**: It was OK. 2.5/5.

**28 Years Later**: There were some nice things here (acting, landscape shots, practical effects, the physicality of the not-zombies), but it felt a little all over the place. 3/5.

**F1**: The story was very predictable and there was a surprising lack of penalties for a movie that marketed itself so much on authenticity, but I'm a biased F1 fan. 4/5.

**Eddington**: I'm not sure if this is the least crazy or most crazy Ari Aster film I've seen. 3.5/5.

**Weapons**: Very unsettling, very funny, and the various plot lines came together nicely. Also, this movie *really* loves tracking shots. Also also, this might be the closest we get to Naruto running in a horror movie. 4.5/5.

**シン・ゴジラ**: 本当に官僚的な映画でしたけど、たくさん面白いところもありました。なお、短いエレベータ言及場面見ましたと思います！ 4/5.

**Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba – The Movie: Infinity Castle**: すごく長い少年漫画的映画でした. 2/5.

**The Long Walk**: Just a nice walk in the countryside with your bros. 3.5/5.
