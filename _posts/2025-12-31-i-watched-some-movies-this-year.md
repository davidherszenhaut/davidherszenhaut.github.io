Welcome to my very professional and very in-depth thoughts on the (new) movies I saw in 2025.

**Companion**: 3.5/5.

**Captain America: Brave New World**: It's just so bad. 1/5.

**The Monkey**: Very fun *Final Destination* style comedy horror. 3/5.

**Mickey 17**: 3/5.

**The Amateur**: 2/5.

**Drop**: It had some tense scenes, but was ultimately a little predictable and had a bit of a rushed ending. 2.5/5.

**Warfare**: 3/5.

**Sinners**: This movie would have been amazing even without the vampires. 4/5.

**Until Dawn**: 3/5.

**Final Destination Bloodlines**: A very fun addition to the franchise that I think fans of the series will enjoy. My only nitpick is the quality of the CGI. 3/5.

**Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning**: More like *Mid-ssion: Impossible*, am I right? 2.5/5.
